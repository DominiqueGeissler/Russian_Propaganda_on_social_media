## Abstract
The Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 was accompanied by a large-scale propaganda campaign. 
Here, we analyze the spread of Russian propaganda on social media. For this, 
we collected N = 349,455 messages from Twitter with pro-Russian content. Our findings suggest
that pro-Russian messages were mainly disseminated through a systematic, coordinated propaganda campaign. 
Overall, pro-Russian content received ∼251,000 retweets and thereby reached around 14.4 million users, 
primarily in countries such as India, South Africa, and the United States. We further provide evidence that
bots played a disproportionate role in the dissemination of propaganda and amplified its proliferation.
Overall, 20.28% of the spreaders are classified as bots, most of which were created in the beginning of the
invasion. Together, our results highlight the new threats to society that originate from coordinated 
propaganda campaigns on social media in modern warfare. Our results also suggest that curbing bots may be 
an effective strategy to mitigate such campaigns.
